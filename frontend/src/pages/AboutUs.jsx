          <p>
            Importance of Ashtadhatu is deeply rooted in Indian culture, religious and ayurvedic traditions. 
            According to astrology, every metal has its inherent energy and has different effects on the human body, 
            in which Ashtadhatu is considered the most effective as it is made from a blend of eight sacred metals i.e. 
            gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, tin, iron, and mercury.
          </p>
          <p>

            Ashtadhatu is known for its spiritual and therapeutic properties. It is often used to craft religious idols, 
            jewelry, and other sacred items.
